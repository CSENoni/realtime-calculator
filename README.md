# realtime-calculator

This realtime calculator app allows multiple users enter and see real time calculation from other users. There are few things about the apps:

- The new user comes in won't see other calculations that were made from other users without his/her presence(new user only see things performed when they are online).
- Users can only do basic calculations (no sin, cos, graph, ...)
- The result(s) will show at the end of the screen (Max is 10). Newer result will replace the oldest result. Newest result comes to the top.
